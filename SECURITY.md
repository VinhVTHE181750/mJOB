## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please create an issue labeled "bug" or "other" in the issues list, describing the vulnerability.
However, the vulnerability is not guaranteed to be fixed, as this is a non-production project for a university subject.
Because of that, at least until September, 2024, we may not accept any external contributions so any PRs will not be reviewed and accepted.
